a:
; increment R1, this will go up until it's equal to 'A'
  inc R1
; jump back to comparisons
  jmp d

; it'll just print 'DONE'
b:
  lsl R3,'D','O','N','E',0x0a
  each R3

c:
; we're going to compare R1 and R2, if R1 is 'A', we'll jump to b, otherwise
; we'll go to `a' and see what we can do from there
  cmp R1,R2,b,a

d:
  jmp c

m:
; dest reg
  mov R2,'A'
; jmp to compare sub
  jmp c
