    <h1>1.0 | Introduction</h1>
    <p>This set of documents provides a low-level insight into VOLT, the
      libre-open source compiler designed for OpenLUD, NexFUSE, and
      MercuryPIC.</p>
    <p>VOLT is a compiler which is designed for the OpenLUD, Mercury, and
      NexFUSE VMs. All of which contain their own specific syntax and features.
      VOLT aims to bridge the gap between different bytecode formats, allowing for
      32-bit and 8-bit VM compilation. Each VM has its own documentation, which
      may not be covered fully in these set of documents.</p>
