    <h1>MercuryVOLT Compiler</h1>

    <p>
      A highly optimized compiler for the OpenLUD and NexFUSE VMs.
      <br />
    <h2>LunarRED VS. MercuryVOLT</h2>
    <p><span class="code">LunarRED</span> is a compiler designed for OpenLUD & NexFUSE, similar
      to VOLT, however, it primarily stands as a reference compiler and standard
      for another language called <i>'LR Assembly'</i>
      <br><br />
      In VOLT, all code is looked at as a whole, it is not stiched together, and can
      generate proper binaries based on code provided. However, LunarRED
      generated a standard that is still primarily used by any LR Assembly
      compilers. You can view the entire LR Assembly standard, as well as
      grammar notations <a href="syntax.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for documentation on the compiler, you can find that <a
