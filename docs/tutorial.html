    <h1>Your First Program</h1>

    <p>
      This tutorial will walk you through the basics of writing a LR Assembly
      program and compiling/executing it with the MercuryVOLT Compiler. VOLT
      contains an implementation of <i>LunarRED Assembly</i>, which is a
      simplistic, modern-day assembly-like language designed to be easily
      compatible between multiple bytecode formats, containing flexible support
      for assembly features like subroutines, labels, comments, and directives.
    </p>

    <p>
      To begin a LR Assembly program, you must first ensure you have the VOLT
      compiler installed on your device. Depending on your build environment, if
      you have a Unix-like/Unix-based environment with a viable C compiler, you
      are able to run `make' from the build directory. You will then have a
      <span class="code">volt32</span> executable in your current working
      directory (the one that you ran `make' in).
    </p>

    <p>As for Windows devices, installing the VOLT compiler will most likely
      require the installation of <i>Cygwin</i>, providing Unix-style abstractions
      to ensure that code that is designed for Unix/Linux can run on Windows
      devices.</p>

    <p>Due to the portable nature of VOLT & it's supported bytecode formats,
      that may not be needed, as long as a viable C compiler is found on your
      device, and you can run `make' / build it from scratch commands, it should
      work perfectly fine. No more than the standard C library is used to design
      VOLT.</p>

    <p>
      As of recent updates, a majority of VOLT programs are now 32-bit, to
      expand features and increase support for a wider variety functionalities
      and features.
    </p>

    <h2>64-bit, 32-bit & 8-bit</h2>

    <p>
      The VOLT compiler supports 32-bit, 64-bit, and 8-bit VMs.
      Which one you are meant to use however, depends on your specific
      environment and use cases.
    </p>

    <p>8-bit compilation is good for smaller, more lenient programs that are
      meant to run smaller operations at lower levels, such as embedded devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      32-bit compilation is good for larger programs that are meant to run
      higher level projects, such as taking in larger amounts of data or storing
      subroutine names higher than 255.
    </p>

    <h2>Program Structure</h2>

    <p>All programs within LR Assembly contain labels, which are similar to
      functions in other programming languages, however, they are bits of code in
      your program which control how your program flows, what instructions are
      meant to be run when, and where.</p>

    <p>
      You can define a simple subroutine by using the `:' character, which is
      meant to be placed AFTER the label, signifying the beginning of the
      subroutine body.

    <div class="some-code">
      <pre>
        {label}:
          instructions
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      In the example above, the `:' character is used to signify the beginning
      of the subroutine, the name being "label".
    </p>

    <p>
      In many different bytecode formats, there is no concept of <b>long</b>
      subroutine headers, since in their definitions, subroutine headers are
      defined, then the body is automatically followed, going up until
      <i>ENDSUB</i> (1) is reached.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now the instructions we will use for this example will be LSL (LOADSHIFT)
      and EACH, both instructions for reading and writing to values in registers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Begin your program by specifying the main label, `m', because a majority
      of VMs support single letter subroutine labels, then use the LOADSHIFT
      instruction to add a list of characters into a register.
    </p>

    <div class="some-code">
      <pre>
        m:
        ; append a string to register 1
        ; 0x0a -> \n in ASCII
          lsl R1,'H','e','l','l','o',0x0a
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      Don't fret if this code may seem complicated at first, it is very simple.
      The LSL instruction is used to take any arguments after specifying a
      retgister, then add them into a register. And ';' is used to signify a
      comment within your code, however, watch out, because inline comments are
      not supported!
    </p>

    <p>
      As for the characters, you can use any ASCII characters within LR
      Assembly, because it supports character literals as well as base10 or
      base16 numbers.
    </p>

    <h3>Printing the Register</h3>

    <p>
      To print the register, you would want to use the EACH instruction. This
      instruction, primarily used as a debugging tool, allows you to print out
      all non-zero contents in a specified register. Keep in mind, this function
      is <b>standard</b>, meaning that this function can be used in any VM
      implementation, due to VOLT's bridging between bytecode formats. It is
      only when you begin to use something known as <i>compiler extensions</i>,
      standards begin to become an issue. However, a majority of the time you do
      not have to worry about this because compilers attempt to bridge every
      kind of extension into code that can be understood by any other VM or
      compiler.
    </p>

    <div class="some-code">
      <pre>
        m:
        ; ...
          lsl R1,'H','e','l','l','o',0x0a

        ; print the register
          each R1
      </pre>
    </div>

    <p>
      To compile this code, simply use the <span class="code">volt32</span>
      command in the same directory as the source code. This source code below
      shows how you would compile for different VMs.

      <pre>
        # compile for NexFUSE
        $ volt32 hello.asm -S nexfuse -o hello.fuse

        # compile for OpenLUD
        $ volt32 hello.asm -S openlud -o hello.lud

        # compile for MercuryPIC
        $ volt32 hello.asm -S mercury -o hello.mc

        # compile to only allow standard functions
        $ volt32 hello.asm -S standard -o hello

        # compile to allow all functions
        $ volt32 hello.asm -S any -o hello
      </pre>
      
      Then, once completed, simply run your binary that is generated in the
      current directory with your VM of choice. Like NexFUSE programs would run
      their apps like this:

      <pre>
        $ runfuse hello
      </pre>

      And like that, you have successfully compiled and run your first program.
      Feel free to explore the source code to learn about different kinds of
      instructions and VMs, and read the README file to understand how to
      configure different options.
